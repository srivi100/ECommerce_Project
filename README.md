# ECommerce_Project
Corizo Minor Project for Internship
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
An e-commerce site is a website where users buy products through an online platform.

Amazon, eBay, and any online retail store fit under this category.

E-commerce websites actually require quite a bit of back-end development.

For example, managing shopping carts throughout a visitorâ€™s duration on the site (and oftentimes after) utilizes an impressive amount of data manipulation.

And APIs help users link their payment information securely by connecting the e-commerce site to financial systems like PayPal

But front-end development is paramount as well. You need front-end development to display goods in a way that attracts customers and to ensure the site is easily navigable.
